Using Google People+AI Research (PAIR)

Artificial intelligence became very popular for its capability of solving real-world problems. It’s
growth to domains different from computer science and mathematics has accomplished great success. 
Even people are taking advantage of AI in their day-to-day life not just for entertainment but also to 
improve their daily-healthy life, like in terms of finance, healthcare, assistance, medical, traffic, and 
others. Due to this huge success of artificial intelligence, it became a very common phrase to use “Can 
we use AI to ______?” or “Can AI solve _____ problem in a unique way?” in everyday life for industry 
product development, industry or academic research, or any kind of profit, non-profit workspace. 
A very famous phrase: “Can we use AI to ______?”, “How might we solve ____?”, “Can AI solve 
this problem in a unique way?”. Developing AI in a human-centered way, we need to identify if AI adds a 
unique value to the product. This can be done by following steps:
 User need: patterns
 Definition of success: optimize/Success
 Scope: Could a non-AI solution work?
 Which AI type is needed? 
In general, identifying whether AI can add a unique value by analyzing the user needs and defining 
the success of the product as a manufacturer. If AI is used then finding optimal ways to translate user’s 
needs into data can be accomplished through alignment, mapping, sourcing, and tuning based on user’s 
perspective. Another factor comes for reasoning that the AI solution used for the product is trustworthy or 
similar parameter, here trust can be calibrated and explained through several ways like interpretability 
includes representation, agnostic & others. This is another side of research based on the nature of the 
product, how to define the interpretability and explainability. For example, as referenced by Google, the 
translating and mapping of the data in android development is a complex problem. Like any other 
commercial product, people will decide whether your product was successful or not. Finally, I would like to 
investigate the challenges of running AI algorithms locally on mobile devices (e.g., battery consumption, 
CPU utilization) and compare this local execution model to the offloading of the execution of AI algorithms 
to computing resources located at the cloud or edge.
